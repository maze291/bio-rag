This directory contains sample data and configuration files to help you get started with BioRAG quickly.

## üìÅ Files Overview

| File | Description | Usage |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `sample_biomedical_text.txt` | Comprehensive biomedical research paper sample | Document ingestion testing |
| `rss_feeds.txt` | Curated list of biomedical RSS feeds | RSS ingestion and real-time updates |

## üöÄ Quick Start Examples

### 1. **Basic Document Processing**

```bash
# Process the sample document
python cli.py --ingest examples/sample_biomedical_text.txt

# Ask questions about it
python cli.py --query "What is the function of BRCA1?"
python cli.py --query "How do PARP inhibitors work?"
python cli.py --query "What are the treatment options for BRCA-associated cancers?"
```

### 2. **RSS Feed Integration**

```bash
# Use a curated RSS feed
python cli.py --rss "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/cancer/" --query "What are the latest cancer research findings?"

# Multiple feeds for comprehensive analysis
python cli.py \
  --rss "https://www.nature.com/nm.rss" \
  --rss "https://www.cell.com/cell/current.rss" \
  --query "Summarize recent advances in precision medicine"
```

### 3. **Web Interface Demo**

```bash
# Start the Streamlit interface
streamlit run main.py

# Then:
# 1. Upload examples/sample_biomedical_text.txt
# 2. Try these questions:
#    - "Explain BRCA1's role in DNA repair"
#    - "What are HRD biomarkers?"
#    - "Compare different PARP inhibitors"
```

# - "How do DNA repair mechanisms work?"
```

**Expected Results**:
- Simplified explanations via glossary tooltips
- Visual entity highlighting
- Links to external databases for deeper learning

```

## üîß Advanced Usage Examples

### **Batch Processing**
```bash
# Process multiple documents and export results
for topic in cancer genetics immunotherapy; do
    python cli.py \
        --rss "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rss/search/${topic}/" \
        --query "Summarize key findings in ${topic}" \
        --export "results_${topic}.json"
done
```

### **Custom Entity Recognition**
```bash
# Focus on specific entity types
python cli.py --ingest examples/sample_biomedical_text.txt --query "List all genes mentioned in this paper"
python cli.py --query "What chemicals and drugs are discussed?"
python cli.py --query "What diseases are associated with these findings?"
```

### **Comparative Analysis**
```bash
# Compare different sources
python cli.py \
    --ingest examples/sample_biomedical_text.txt \
    --rss "https://www.nature.com/ng.rss" \
    --query "How do these findings compare to recent genetics research?"
```

## üìù Creating Your Own Examples

### **1. Document Examples**
Create files with rich biomedical content:
```
examples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cardiology_paper.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ neuroscience_abstract.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clinical_trial_results.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ genomics_review.txt
```

### **2. Domain-Specific RSS Lists**
Create specialized feed collections:
```
examples/feeds/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cardiology_feeds.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ neuroscience_feeds.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oncology_feeds.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ genetics_feeds.txt
```

### **3. Question Templates**
Prepare domain-specific question sets:
```python
# examples/question_templates.py
GENETICS_QUESTIONS = [
    "What genes are associated with {disease}?",
    "How does {gene} mutation affect {process}?",
    "What are the therapeutic targets in {pathway}?"
]
```

## üé® Customization Tips

### **Tailoring for Your Research Area**
1. **Replace sample document** with papers from your field
2. **Update RSS feeds** to focus on your research interests  
3. **Customize entity knowledge base** with domain-specific terms
4. **Add field-specific glossary terms** for your jargon

### **Creating Demo Scenarios**
1. **Prepare realistic questions** that showcase BioRAG's strengths
2. **Use documents with rich entity content** (genes, drugs, diseases)
3. **Include complex concepts** that benefit from jargon simplification
4. **Test entity linking** to ensure major terms have database links

## üîç Troubleshooting Examples

### **No Results Found**
```bash
# Check if documents were processed
python cli.py --query "How many documents are in the database?"

# Verify entity recognition
python cli.py --query "What entities were found in the uploaded documents?"
```

### **Poor Quality Results**
```bash
# Try more specific questions
python cli.py --query "What is the molecular mechanism of BRCA1 in DNA repair?"
# Instead of: "Tell me about BRCA1"

# Use multiple documents
python cli.py --ingest doc1.pdf doc2.pdf --query "your question"
```

### **RSS Feed Issues**
```bash
# Test individual feeds
python cli.py --rss "https://www.nature.com/nm.rss" --query "test"

# Check feed validity
curl -I "https://www.nature.com/nm.rss"
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the sample document before adding your own
2. **Use Specific Questions**: "How does X affect Y?" works better than "Tell me about X"
3. **Combine Sources**: Mix documents and RSS feeds for comprehensive answers
4. **Leverage Entity Links**: Click through to external databases for deeper research
5. **Export Results**: Save interesting Q&A sessions for future reference
6. **Test Regularly**: Use the self-test to verify everything works after changes
