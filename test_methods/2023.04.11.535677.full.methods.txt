(A) Unlabeled or deuterium-enriched CH4 is formed from unlabeled biomass (grey dots) or deuterated biomass (red dots), respectively. (B) Stable carbon isotope values of cultures from the methanogen Methanothermobacter marburgensis, heat-, or light-generated CH4. All experiments were conducted in closed glass vials containing a buffered solution (A, B – heat, light) or culture medium (B – methanogenesis), supplemented with Fe3+ and ascorbate (A) or Fe2+ and citrate (B – heat, light) under a nitrogen atmosphere, incubated under light at 30 °C or in the dark at 97 °C. Statistical analysis was performed using paired two-tailed t-tests, *: p ≤ 0.05. The bars are the mean + standard deviation of three independent measurements, shown as circles. The obtained dead biomass was supplemented with Fe3+ and ascorbate and incubated under broad- spectrum light. Around 40 fmol CH4 h-1 mg-1 dry weight was obtained from labeled and unlabeled biomass (Fig. 5A). In addition, stable hydrogen isotope values (δ2H) of CH4 from D2O-treated biomass showed strong enrichment in deuterium (~5900 ‰) in comparison to unlabeled biomass (~-225 ‰), demonstrating a direct conversion of isotopically labeled biomass to CH4. This suggests that the availability of biomass, upon the emergence of life, has increased the CH4 9

The presence of CH4 has been suggested to be crucial for the evolution of life, since it could serve as life´s first carbon source via methanotrophy(50–52). Following this line of thought, we could demonstrate that methanotrophic Methylocystis hirsuta grew on CH4 generated by our light-driven model system, transferred to the headspace of the M. hirsuta culture (Fig. S13). In fact, the “last methane-metabolizing ancestor” had likely the genes to perform methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation(53), suggesting that, under high CH4 concentrations, methanotrophy could have emerged prior to methanogenesis. Finally, we speculated that ROS-driven CH4 formation leads to different stable carbon isotope values (δ13C) compared to biological processes, i.e., methanogenesis. The observed δ13C values for CH4 generated by heat or light were less negative (~-54 ± 1.1 ‰) compared to the δ13C value of the methanogen Methanothermobacter marburgensis (~-59.2 ± 2.3 ‰, Fig. 5B). While the isotopic fractionation during abiotic ROS-driven CH4 formation remains to be studied in depth, these
