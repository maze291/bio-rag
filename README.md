# BioRAG - Biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Generation System

## What This Project Is

BioRAG is a specialized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed specifically for biomedical and scientific literature. It combines advanced document processing, intelligent chunking, ensemble retrieval, and numerical data extraction to enable precise question-answering over scientific papers.

## The Problem This Solves

Scientific papers contain complex numerical data, chemical formulas, experimental conditions, and measurements that traditional RAG systems struggle to extract accurately. For example:

- **Before:** "What are the methane formation rates?" → Vague or missing numerical answers
- **After:** "CH formation rates increased 41-fold to ~0.82 μM·h⁻¹ at 97°C"

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Ingestion Pipeline (`biorag/core/ingest.py`)
- **Multi-format support**: PDFs, HTML, plain text, RSS feeds
- **OCR fallback**: Handles scanned PDFs with Tesseract
- **Scientific text cleaning**: Preserves chemical formulas, units, and numerical patterns
- **Smart chunking**: 1500 characters with 450-character overlap for numerical continuity
- **Section-aware parsing**: Identifies Methods, Results, Discussion sections

### 2. Vector Database Management (`biorag/core/vectordb.py`)
- **Embedding models**: Sentence-transformers for scientific text
- **ChromaDB persistence**: Efficient similarity search
- **Metadata enrichment**: Document IDs, chunk indexing, section tagging
- **Model compatibility**: Handles embedding model changes gracefully

### 3. Enhanced Retrieval System (`biorag/core/`)
- **Ensemble Retriever**: Combines BM25 (keyword) + Dense (semantic) search
- **Neighbor Expansion**: Retrieves adjacent chunks for context continuity  
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Fine-tuned relevance scoring
- **Numerical Boost**: Prioritizes chunks containing query numbers/patterns
- **Section Boosting**: Weights Methods/Results sections higher for data queries

### 4. RAG Chain Orchestration (`biorag/core/rag_chain.py`)
- **Query Analysis**: Detects complex vs. simple queries
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex questions into sub-queries
- **HyDE Generation**: Creates hypothetical documents for better retrieval
- **Scientific Pattern Detection**: Identifies numerical/chemical queries
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assesses answer reliability

### 5. Specialized Components
- **Entity Linking** (`biorag/core/entity_linker.py`): Links chemicals, genes, proteins to databases
- **Glossary Management** (`biorag/core/glossary.py`): Simplifies scientific jargon
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking** (`biorag/core/reranker.py`): Advanced relevance ranking

## The Point of This Project

This system demonstrates that with proper RAG engineering, you can build domain-specific AI assistants that:

1. **Understand Scientific Context**: Unlike general RAG systems, this handles chemical formulas, experimental conditions, and numerical measurements correctly

2. **Extract Precise Information**: Can find specific values like "41-fold increase to ~0.82 μM·h⁻¹ at 97°C" from large document collections

3. **Provide Reliable Sources**: Every answer is backed by specific document references and page numbers

4. **Scale to Large Collections**: Architecture supports thousands of papers with fast retrieval

5. **Adapt to Domain Needs**: Specialized components for biomedical entity linking, jargon explanation, and scientific notation handling

## Current Status: WORKING ✅

**Problem Solved**: The numerical extraction issue has been resolved through:

- **Enhanced QA Prompt**: Now explicitly requests numerical values with units
- **Improved Chunking**: 450-character overlap preserves numerical continuity
